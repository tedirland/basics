# Things to remember for variables:

1. They can only be one word
2. They cannot start with a number and cannot contain symbols like % or #
3. The word used only matters to the developer. Python doesn't care if the variable is x or countries_by_population. Be descriptive for yourself
4. python_traditionally_uses_snake_case for a way to have multiword variables but still in one word. Each word is separated by an underscore _
5. youCanUseCamelCase, but snake_case remains the standard. Each new word is capitalized except the first.
